# PORTFOLIO
## About me 
  Hello everyone!
  
  My name is Anastasia and I am a quality assurance engineer. I started my journey by testing the website of the e-commerce platform (testing was part of my job duties). This was my first experience after which I decided to develop in the direction of testing. I have completed manual testing courses, take part in various challenges and get inspired by automation. I have a technical background, which helps me to easily perceive large amounts of technical information. Now I am in search of work, I will be glad to your offers.
  
  #### My experience
At my last job, I was a project manager in an e-commerce project. One of my responsibilities was testing new versions of the site: functional testing, user interface testing. I communicated with the development team and took part in the improvement and development of new functionalities. At the moment I am developing in the direction of automated testing, taking part in challenges and practicing writing autotests for selenium + python.
